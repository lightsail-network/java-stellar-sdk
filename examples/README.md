# Stellar Java SDK Examples

This directory contains a number of helpful examples. Please note:

1. The scripts may contain private keys and addresses, you may need to generate new private keys and addresses
   in [Stellar Laboratory](https://laboratory.stellar.org/#account-creator?network=test) to replace them, and you may
   need to fund them in the network.
2. The script will be updated with the SDK update, so you may need to find the example corresponding to the SDK version
   you are using, and you can
   click [this link](https://github.com/lightsail-network/java-stellar-sdk/releases) to find the corresponding version.
